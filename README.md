## Hello everyone 👋

#### I'm a full-stack developer, I code all kinds of stuff for my own pleasure and to improve my knowledge. I have a stronger focus on the backend. I am a designer by education

I own a discord server [scuttle](https://discord.gg/scuttle) with bots written by me for communication and entertainment;<br>
Main site [eeaq.xyz](https://eeaq.xyz), where you can also see my stacks, a short biography about me, and projects that will be updated over time;<br>

- 💻 This is usually the most commonly used programming language: `react`, `javasript/typescript`, `mongodb`, `nestjs`;
- 📝 For writing documentation, notes, and a place where I write it all: `nvim`, `vscode`, `cloudAI`, `.md`;<br>

💭 You can ping me to contact me about collaboration, or how to develop a design, or how to develop it as I stack it;
